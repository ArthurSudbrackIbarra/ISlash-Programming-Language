**ISlash** is a dynamically typed, interpreted programming language with **no real use** that I created for fun, which runs on top of [Golang](https://go.dev/). The language somewhat resembles Assembly but it is simpler to understand and more high-level.

My main goal when creating ISlash was learning Golang (Go), as I had never used that language before. The name 'ISlash' is a pun with my last name 'Ibarra', because 'barra' means 'slash' in portuguese, which is my native language.

## Example Programs

Example programs using the ISlash language can be found inside the [example programs folder](https://github.com/ArthurSudbrackIbarra/ISlash-Programming-Language/tree/main/example-programs). There you'll find simple scripts showcasing the instructions of the language, as well as more advanced ones, such as a **bubblesort**, **hangman**, **tic-tac-toe game** and a **csv reader** script.

In the example below, we are multiplying numbers inputed by the user.

## Data Types

|  Type  | Description                                                                                                  |
| :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| string | Strings are declared with double quotes. Ex: "Hello!"                                                        |
| number | Numbers may or may not have decimal places. Ex: 1, 2.3                                                       |
| array  | Arrays are declared with square brackets. Ex: [1,2,3], ["Hi","Hello"]. Do **not** put spaces between commas. |

In ISlash, although there is not a boolean data type, numbers can be used to represent boolean values:

| Boolean Value | Numbers Range |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
|     true      |  numbers â‰¥ 1  |
|     false     |  numbers < 0  |

Basic example programs using each of the instructions listed above can be found [here](https://github.com/ArthurSudbrackIbarra/ISlash-Programming-Language/tree/main/example-programs/instructions-examples).

## Language Features

Below, some ISlash language features will be explained:

### Comments

Comments can be made using the `#` character at the beginning of lines:

```
# This is a comment!
say "Cool!"
```

### String interpolation

ISlash allows the interpolation of Strings using the `$()` symbol:

```
var name "Arthur"
var age 20
say "My name is $(name) and I am $(age) years old."
```

### New Lines in Strings

To represent new lines, use the `\n` symbol:

```
say "Hi!\nThis is in a new line!"
```

## Things to Notice

Here are some important things to notice about the ISlash language:

### 1. Variables

1. All variables are global and can be accessed from anywhere, as there are no scopes. If you create a variable inside an _if_ block, you **will** be able to reference it outside of the _if_ block. The only **exception** to this rule are _foreach_ element variables, which only exists inside the _foreach_ block.

Example:

```
foreach element [1,2,3]
    # element exists here!
endforeach
# element does not exist here!
```

2. The **VAR** command will create new variables if they don't exist yet. If they do, the previous value will be replaced by the new one.

### 2. Arrays

1. Even though ISlash is a dynamically typed language, arrays **cannot** contain values of different types. Because of that, when creating an **empty array**, you must specify if it will contain numbers or strings.

Example:

```
# OK!

var array [1,2,3]
var array ["Hello","Bye"]
var array []number
var array []string

# NOT OK!

var array []
```

## Try ISlash - Playground

If you're curious and want to try out the ISlash language, the steps below will teach you how to setup a playground Docker container with ISlash installed and a collection of example programs for you to run.

### Installation

1. Download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArthurSudbrackIbarra/ISlash-Programming-Language.git
```

3. Go to the repository directory.

```sh
cd ISlash-Programming-Language
```

4. Start the playground Docker container:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

5. Enter inside the Docker container that you started:

```sh
docker exec -it islash-playground-container sh
```

6. Run the ISlash programs you wish with:

```sh
islash <PATH_TO_MY_PROGRAM>

# Example:
islash my-program.isl
```

![Running Programs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69170322/183551455-e2b7d46f-7115-4a69-a03a-eafb5b67a323.png)

**NOTE**: All files inside the 'example-programs' directory are shared between your host machine and the Docker container using a **bind mount volume**, so you can modify the .isl files or create new ones in your host machine and then run them from inside the container.

**TIP:** You can automatize steps 4-5 using the scripts inside the `automation-scripts` folder: `start-container.bat` and `start-container.sh`, depending on your OS.

### Uninstallation

To completely delete all the resources created in your machine, use the following commands:

1. Stop the container.

```sh
docker compose down
```

2. Delete the container.

```sh
docker rm islash-playground-container
```

3. Delete the container image.

```sh
docker rmi islash-programming-language_islash-playground
```

## Install ISlash Locally

To install ISlash locally in your machine instead of using Docker, perform the following steps:

1. Download [Go ^1.19](https://go.dev/dl/).

2. Clone this repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArthurSudbrackIbarra/ISlash-Programming-Language.git
```

3. Go to the repository directory.

```sh
cd ISlash-Programming-Language
```

4. Build the ISlash executable, the command below will generate an 'islash.exe' file on Windows or an 'islash' file on unix based operating systems.

```sh
go build -o islash
```

5. Add the executable to your PATH.

- (Windows) Add the repository directory to your PATH environment variable.

- (Unix) Move the created executable 'islash' to /usr/bin.

```sh
sudo mv islash /usr/bin
```

## ISlash Docker Hub Image

ISlash has an official [Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/magicmanatee/islash) that you can pull and use in your projects. See the example below:

**Directory Structure**:

```
My-ISlash-Project/
â”œâ”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€ main.isl
```

**Dockerfile Example**:

```
FROM magicmanatee/islash:1.0
WORKDIR /home/my-islash-project
COPY . .
CMD ["islash", "main.isl"]
```

## Possible Future Features

These are some of the features that I might implement in the future:

- Functions
- Switch/Case
- Foreach with indexes, not only elements.
- 'continue' instruction to be used inside while loops.
